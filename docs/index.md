- Assignments before the class of Jan 10, 2025: Read the materials related to embeddings, neural networks and transformers, linked in this [section](text.md#contenidos-a-preparar-antes-de-la-sesion-del-10012025) and then complete [this test](https://forms.gle/7KDwRtXcrpxsKjHp7) (deadline: 23:59 CET, Jan 9 2025).
- Assignments before the class of Dec 20, 2024: This class will have two parts taught by different teachers; therefore, your assignments will deal with two different topics. Firstly, read the new contents of section [_Introduction to computational linguistics and natural language processing_](cl.md); after that, complete [this test](https://forms.gle/ZkDWRSRSzB4p7Ugy7) and read the article "The Future of Computational Linguistics: On Beyond Alchemy" [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2021.625341/full) (Reading time: one hour and a half) (deadline: 23:59 CET, Dec 19 2024). Secondly, read the materials related to logistic regressors and PyTorch linked in this [section](text.md#contenidos-a-preparar-antes-de-la-sesion-del-20122024) and then complete [this test](https://forms.gle/V3U9MTHo7c9DNhkc6) (same deadline: 23:59 CET, Dec 19 2024).

## Course Syllabus and Rules

These are the teaching materials for the course Técnicas de Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural, coordinated by professor [Juan Antonio Pérez Ortiz][japerez_url] ([@japer3z][japerez_twitter]) at the University of Alacant and also taught by professor [Miquel Esplà Gomis][miquel_url].

For information regarding the course assessment, please refer to the [course official info page][syllabus]. Some additional aspects not covered in the syllabus include:

- Practical assignments are to be completed individually or in pairs, as indicated in each assignment description. Each of the course blocks (computational linguistics, text, speech) will have one or more practical assignments. The assignments in the first block contribute 25% to the final grade, the second block assignments contribute 55%, and the third block assignments contribute 20%. In case, the speech block has no practical assignments, the contributions of the first and second blocks will be 22% and 78%, respectively.
- Attendance in practical sessions is mandatory. Roll call will be taken in each in-person session. A maximum of 1 unexcused absence is allowed. If a student accumulates more unexcused absences than the allowed limit, they will not be able to pass the practical component of the course in the C2 examination. However, they will have the opportunity to pass it in the C4.

Please note that the content may change throughout the course.

The course has three blocks:

* Block 1: [Introduction to computational linguistics and natural language processing](cl.md)
* Block 2: [Architectures for written-text processing](text.md)
* Block 3: [Architectures for speech](speech.md)
